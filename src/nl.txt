Article 1: Enhancing Data Governance in Finance with Knowledge Graphs
Title: Strengthening Data Governance in Finance with Knowledge Graphs

In the complex landscape of financial services, robust data governance is paramount. Knowledge graphs are emerging as a powerful tool to enhance data governance, ensuring compliance with standards such as DAMA (Data Management Association) and DCAM (Data Management Capability Assessment Model), and supporting regulatory initiatives like BCBS 239.

Understanding Data Governance

Data governance encompasses the policies, procedures, and standards that ensure the effective management of an organization’s data assets. It aims to enhance data quality, security, and accessibility while complying with regulatory requirements.

The Role of Knowledge Graphs

Knowledge graphs provide a dynamic, interconnected view of data relationships, making them ideal for improving data governance in finance. Here’s how they contribute:

Data Lineage and Traceability
Knowledge graphs enable detailed tracking of data lineage—understanding where data originates, how it flows through systems, and how it is transformed. This is critical for compliance with BCBS 239, which mandates accurate risk data aggregation and reporting.

Data Quality Management
By visualizing relationships and dependencies, knowledge graphs help identify data quality issues, such as inconsistencies and duplications. This aligns with DAMA guidelines, which emphasize data quality as a cornerstone of data management.

Policy Enforcement
Knowledge graphs facilitate the implementation and monitoring of data governance policies. They can map out data access controls and ensure that policies are consistently applied across the organization, supporting DCAM's focus on capability and maturity assessment.
